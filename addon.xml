        <summary lang="en_GB">Collection-aware TV &amp; movie browser with linked movies, tag filtering, and shared collections</summary>
        <description lang="en_GB">Replaces the standard library browser with a collection-aware TV and movie browser. Group related TV shows and movies into collections, manage linked movies across franchise boundaries, and sync your setup across multiple Kodi installs via MySQL.

Features:
- TV Collections: combine related shows into one item in the title listing.
- Movie Collections: group related movies, or import existing Kodi movie sets via Migrate Movie Sets in addon settings.
- Linked Movies: movies linked to a TV show appear alongside its seasons and episodes. Move them between the show listing and collection level via context menu.
- Shared Collections: sync collection config across Kodi installs using the same MySQL server. Enable in addon settings.
- Tag Filtering: browse TV shows and movies by library tag. Root menu includes dedicated tag folders.
- Flatten Seasons: respects Kodi's "Flatten TV show seasons" setting, skipping single-season shows straight to episodes.
- Select First Unwatched: respects Kodi's "Select first unwatched TV show season/episode" setting.
- Include Specials: respects Kodi's "Include All Seasons and Specials" setting.
- Forced Views: sets skin forced views for seasons, episodes, TV shows, and movies on first run.

All collections are managed entirely through context menus. Use as a replacement for library://video/ in skin widgets and shortcuts.</description>
